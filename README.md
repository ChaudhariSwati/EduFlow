🛠️ Setup & Development Guidelines
Follow these steps to set up the project locally and maintain code quality:

1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js (v16+) installed.

Use npm or yarn as your package manager.
2. Local Installation
Bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/ChaudhariSwati/EduFlow.git](https://github.com/ChaudhariSwati/EduFlow.git)

# Enter the directory
cd EduFlow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the local development server
npm run dev
3. Development Workflow
State Management: All authentication and assignment data are handled via AppContext.jsx. Do not prop-drill; use the useApp() hook.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid writing custom CSS in index.css unless global resets are needed.

Components: Create new components in the components/ folder. Ensure they are functional components using React Hooks.
